This python3 application show's a pong example where two instances of the algorythm play against each other.

To running it you may need additional librarys (for example: pip3 install pygame)

Start command: 
python3 AI.py

To setup the game speed modulate the FPS (400 is quiet fast) variable in Pong.py.

Have fun! :-)
